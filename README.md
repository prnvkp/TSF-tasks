## About The Sparks Foundation
The S.P.A.R.K.S. Foundation is a 501©3 non-profit organization dedicated to the mission of providing hands-on science education to elementary-aged students, regardless of socio-economic status.
The philosophy of the S.P.A.R.K.S. Foundation is grounded in the fact that learning in science begins in early childhood. Young minds are curious about science and ready to engage in the practices and language of science. These principles— learned at an early age—form a foundation to be built upon and strengthened throughout a student’s K-12 education. 
Studies show that our nation’s employers are asking for more employees who have the technical skills to help them compete in today’s economy.  We need more engineers, chemists, computer programmers, healthcare professionals, etc. and we must start with our youth to inspire them now to pursue STEM learning and careers later on.
